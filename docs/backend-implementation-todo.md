## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)

### 1. Database Design & Setup
- [ ] **Database Schema Design**
  - Users table (chefs and attendees)
  - Events table (dinner events)
  - Reservations table (attendee bookings)
  - Payments table (transaction tracking)
  - Reviews table (post-dinner feedback)
  - Receipts table (uploaded receipt data)

- [ ] **Database Technology Selection**
  - Consider: PostgreSQL (relational) vs MongoDB (document)
  - Recommendation: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex relationships
  - Set up database migrations and seeding
  - Configure connection pooling and backup strategies

- [ ] **ORM/Database Layer**
  - Set up Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
  - Define Prisma schema with relationships
  - Generate TypeScript types from database schema
  - Set up database seeding with realistic test data

### 2. Authentication & User Management
- [ ] **Authentication System**
  - Choose auth provider: Auth0, Firebase Auth, or NextAuth.js
  - Implement JWT token management
  - Set up role-based access control (chef vs attendee)
  - Password reset and email verification flows

- [ ] **User Profiles**
  - Chef profile management with Venmo integration
  - Attendee profile with dietary restrictions and preferences
  - Profile photo upload and storage (AWS S3 or Cloudinary)
  - User preference management and notification settings

### 3. Core API Endpoints
- [ ] **Event Management APIs**
  ```
  POST /api/events - Create new dinner event (chef only)
  GET /api/events - List events with filtering/pagination
  GET /api/events/[id] - Get event details
  PUT /api/events/[id] - Update event (chef only)
  DELETE /api/events/[id] - Cancel event (chef only)
  ```

- [ ] **Reservation Management APIs**
  ```
  POST /api/reservations - Create reservation
  GET /api/reservations - List user's reservations
  PUT /api/reservations/[id] - Update reservation
  DELETE /api/reservations/[id] - Cancel reservation
  GET /api/events/[id]/reservations - Get event reservations (chef only)
  ```

- [ ] **User Management APIs**
  ```
  GET /api/users/profile - Get user profile
  PUT /api/users/profile - Update user profile
  POST /api/users/chef/setup - Setup chef profile with Venmo
  ```

  - OCR integration for image receipts (Google Cloud Vision API)
  - Automatic ingredient extraction and cost calculation

- [ ] **Image Handling**
  - Profile photo upload and resizing
  - Event photo management
  - Recipe photo sharing post-dinner
  - HEIC to JPEG conversion pipeline

---

## Phase 3: Analytics & Optimization (Lower Priority)

### 7. Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] **Chef Analytics Dashboard**
  - Event performance metrics (attendance, revenue)
  - Popular dish tracking and seasonal trends
  - Attendee feedback analysis and ratings
  - Financial reporting and tax documentation

- [ ] **Attendee Insights**
  - Personal dining history and spending
  - Favorite cuisines and chef preferences
  - Dietary tracking and nutrition insights
  - Social dining patterns and friend networks

### 8. Search & Recommendations
- [ ] **Advanced Search**
  - Elasticsearch or Algolia integration
  - Full-text search across events and chefs
  - Geolocation-based event discovery
  - Smart filters with faceted search

- [ ] **Recommendation Engine**
  - Machine learning-based event recommendations
  - Collaborative filtering for similar users
  - Chef matching based on cooking style
  - Seasonal and trending event suggestions

### 9. Community Features
- [ ] **Social Features**
  - Friend connections and social networks
  - Group reservation management
  - Event sharing and invitation system
  - Community forums and discussion boards

- [ ] **Review & Rating System**
  - Post-dinner review collection
  - Chef rating aggregation and display
  - Photo sharing and recipe exchanges

## API Design Patterns

### RESTful API Guidelines
```typescript
// Standard response format
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean
  data?: T
  error?: {
    code: string
    message: string
    details?: any
  }
  pagination?: {
    page: number
    limit: number
    total: number
    totalPages: number
  }
}

// Error handling middleware
interface ApiError {
  status: number
  code: string
  message: string
  details?: any
}
```

### Database Schema (Prisma)
```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  role      Role     @default(ATTENDEE)
  profile   UserProfile?
  events    Event[]  @relation("ChefEvents")
  reservations Reservation[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Event {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String?
  chefId      String
  chef        User     @relation("ChefEvents", fields: [chefId], references: [id])
  date        DateTime
  maxCapacity Int
  status      EventStatus @default(OPEN)
  reservations Reservation[]
  // ... additional fields
}
```
