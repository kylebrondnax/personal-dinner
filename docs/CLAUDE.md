# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Family Dinner planning App - a sophisticated event management platform designed to help chefs host dinner events and manage cost-splitting with attendees. The application has evolved significantly beyond the initial MVP and now includes comprehensive event management, availability polling, reservation systems, and user authentication.

## Architecture

### Data Models (Database Schema)

**Core Models:**
```typescript
// User Management
User (id, email, name, role, profile)
UserProfile (venmoUsername, dietaryRestrictions, bio, city, etc.)

// Event Management  
Event (id, title, date, status, capacity, polling, chef)
EventLocation (address, neighborhood, city, privacy)
EventIngredient (name, estimatedCost, actualCost)

// Reservation System
Reservation (id, userId, eventId, status, guestCount, payments)

// Polling System
ProposedDate (id, eventId, date, time)
AvailabilityResponse (userId, proposedDateId, available, tentative)

// Content & Reviews
Receipt (id, eventId, fileUrl, ocrText, parsedItems)
Review (id, eventId, userId, ratings, content)
```

**Enums:**
- UserRole: CHEF | ATTENDEE | ADMIN  
- EventStatus: DRAFT | POLL_ACTIVE | OPEN | FULL | CANCELLED | COMPLETED
- ReservationStatus: CONFIRMED | WAITLIST | CANCELLED
- PollStatus: ACTIVE | CLOSED | FINALIZED

### System Architecture

**Layered Architecture Pattern:**
```
API Layer (Next.js Route Handlers)
    â†“
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    â†“

    â†“
Database Layer (Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL)
```

## Database Operations Guide

### Common Queries
```typescript
// Get events with filtering
EventRepository.findMany({ search, maxPrice, city, cuisineTypes })

// Create reservation with validation
ReservationService.createReservation({ eventId, userId, guestCount })

// Poll operations
EventService.createEventWithPoll({ chefAvailability, pollDeadline })
```

### Migration Management
- `npx prisma migrate dev` - Create and apply new migration
- `npx prisma db push` - Push schema changes without migration
- `npx prisma studio` - Visual database browser
- `npm run db:seed` - Populate with sample data

## Business Logic Notes

### Event Lifecycle
1. **DRAFT** â†’ **POLL_ACTIVE** (if using polling)
2. **POLL_ACTIVE** â†’ **OPEN** (after poll finalization)
3. **OPEN** â†’ **FULL** (when capacity reached)
4. **FULL** â†’ **OPEN** (when reservations cancelled)
5. **Any Status** â†’ **CANCELLED** (chef cancellation)
6. **OPEN/FULL** â†’ **COMPLETED** (after event date)

### Reservation Business Rules
- Maximum 10 guests per reservation
- Waitlist automatic promotion (FIFO)
- 24-hour cancellation policy (configurable)
- Guest reservations require email validation
- Duplicate reservation prevention per user/event

### Polling System Rules
- Minimum 2 proposed dates required
- Poll deadline must be before earliest proposed date
- Chef must mark availability before creating poll
- Responses locked after poll deadline
- Email notifications sent to all participants (integration ready)

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Husky pre-commit hooks run ESLint
- Conventional commit messages recommended
- Feature branch workflow with PR reviews

### Database Workflow
1. Update `schema.prisma` with changes
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name description`
3. Update TypeScript types if needed
4. Test with `npm run db:seed`

### API Development
1. Define TypeScript interfaces in `/types`
2. Create repository methods for data access
3. Implement business logic in service layer
4. Create API route handlers with validation
5. Update frontend components to consume API

## Testing Strategy

### Recommended Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer business logic
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with test database
- **Component Tests**: React components with React Testing Library
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows with Playwright

### Test Data Management
- Use `prisma/seed.ts` for consistent test data
- Separate test database for integration tests
- Mock external services (email, file uploads)

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgresql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
```
